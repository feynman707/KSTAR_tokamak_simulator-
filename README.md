# KSTAR tokamak simulator (KSTAR-NN)
- KSTAR is a tokamak (donut-shaped nuclear fusion device) located in South Korea.
- This repository provides a KSTAR tokamak simulation tool with LSTM-based neural network.
- See also [AI Tokamak Control](https://github.com/jaem-seo/AI_tokamak_control) where the AI replaces the manual control of this simulator.

# Installation
- You can install by
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jaem-seo/KSTAR_tokamak_simulator.git
$ cd KSTAR_tokamak_simulator
```

# Try it out
- Open the GUI by typing below. It might take a bit depending on your environment.
```
$ python kstar_simulator_v0.py
```

- Slide the toggles in the left side and see the fusion plasma evolution in the right side.

- I hope you get insight with this virtual experiment!

# Note
- This simulation has been tested with many real discharges, and shows acceptable prediction accuracy.

</p>

- But it does not always guarantee perfect prediction since it doesn't account for all unknown factors.
- For example, the experiments #18672 and #22671 were conducted under almost the same setting, but showed quite different behaviors.
- In this case, the simulation shows quite a reasonable, average prediction as shown below.
